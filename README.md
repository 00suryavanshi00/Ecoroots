## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

The backend for this is on [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) which is deployed on [Render](https://render.com/).

Here's the live link to the deployed [EcoRoots Strapi](https://ecoroots-strapicms.onrender.com) project. 
This is on a free deployment service so because of cold boot it'll be a little slow for the very first api hit, plz be patient! :D


## Live link to this project is right here ðŸ‘‰ [Link](https://ecoroots-590516909829.asia-south1.run.app/)
There are some img related bugs in this one it's work in progress though. Doing it alone ðŸ¥²
